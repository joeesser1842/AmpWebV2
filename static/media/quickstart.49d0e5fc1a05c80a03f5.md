## Advanced Members: Migrating an Existing Project onto the Amp Lab website (Mentees):

Some people joining the Amp Lab already have GitHub repos with their project details. We want to support this, and allow you all to link them into our site! Just shoot the link to your mentor, and you're good to go! Alternatively, you could make a PR to add it to the repos.yaml file found here:

<a class="btn" href="https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/AmpWebV2" >Submit a Pull Request for your Project</a>
